This is the read me file for First Fictional VII this is my project for week 4!

The concept

Basically the plan is to try and make a game which has a fully working combat system, based on number rolls between the values 1-10. 
You and the monsters will all have levels, experiance will be granted and there will be a fully working inventory allowing you to 
equip new items from your "backpack" which have benifical stats such as damage and armor.

The plan is to make a health counter that will always have a fixed max health of 10, the damage taken will be caluclated based on your
armor, the enemies level and the enemies attack. 

As it stands I aim to have it so that everytime you move in to a room there is a chance for a *monster* to spawn. Every monster will 
have a loot table with a rng chance for each item. The aim will be to walk around and kill the monsters whilst getting gear to be able
to kill the last boss *Crafty Kirill*. A set amount of armor will be required so that you aren't killed instantly, as well as needing a
good enough weapon to be able damage him. 

I've not quite decided on what will happen if you die, but I think having to start again from the beginning is the best way as I don't 
want everyone who tries this to be able to complete it. It is designed to be hard and require some luck to beat! 

My plan for the combat system is as follows, when it is your turn to attack, you have to enter a number between 0-10 (inclusive). The 
opponet will also guess a number between 0-10, the aim if you are attacking is to get the number as far away from theirs as possible
as the damage will be calculated as the difference between the numbers (armor will have an effect as well) e.g. I roll 7 and the oponent
rolls 3, 7-3 = 4 so you will deal 4 damage + your bonus attack from you weapon - the targets armor.
